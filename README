BUILD STEPS
#############################################################
1. Following steps are required for compilation
   a. cd market 
   b. mkdir build && cd build
   c. cmake ../
   d. make all -j
2. 3 binaries will be created inside 3 folders mentioned below

   market_data_provider/
   mcast_sender/
   tcp_client/

3. market_data_provider binary is  main binary. it listens to multicast data feed using mcast_sender binary. tcp_client binary is the downward app which listens
   to market_data_provider. mcast_sender is binary to feed the multicast data.


HOW TO RUN THE BINARY
##############################################################
1. Run market_data_provider : ./market_data_provider 0.0.0.0 239.255.0.1 
- it joins multicast port and listens for incoming clients connect at port 40001 (presently hard coded)

2. Subscribe the tcp_ client with required subscription type: ./tcp_client 127.0.0.1 40001 7
- It has capablity to subscribe combination of 3 messages MarketStatus(1), Quote(2), Trade statistics(4) - combination could be provided by sending 5 which means subscribe to Trade Statistics and Market status

3.Feed the data using: ./mcast_sender 239.255.0.1 1
- it requires a binary file which has relevant messages. The file messages.dat is kept in doc folder. This should be copied in the folder from where we run mcast_sender binary. messages.dat.9999 contains 9999 Quote message, 9999 Trade message and 2 Market status message.
