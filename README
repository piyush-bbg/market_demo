BUILD STEPS
#############################################################
1. Following steps are required for compilation
   a. cd market_demo
   b. mkdir build && cd build
   c. cmake ../
   d. make all -j

NOTE: Project is dependent on boost libraries. I have built the project using boost 1.55.0. Please provide the boost path for compilation. In my machine I have configured following enviornment variables, where boost include files and libraries can be found.

PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/boost_1_55_0/stage/lib
BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local/boost_1_55_0

If you get boost requirment issue , please provide following variables in cmake.
Boost_INCLUDE_DIR         - Directory containing Boost headers
Boost_LIBRARY_DIR         - Directory containing Boost librarie

Please refer: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/FindBoost.html

2. 3 binaries will be created inside the build, inside respective folders as mentioned below

   market_data_provider/
   mcast_sender/
   tcp_client/

3. market_data_provider binary is  main binary. it listens to multicast data feed provided by mcast_sender binary. tcp_client binary is the downward app which listens TCP data sent by market_data_provider. mcast_sender is binary to feed the multicast data. It reads messages.dat file to provide the data. 


HOW TO RUN THE BINARY
##############################################################
1. Run market_data_provider : ./market_data_provider 0.0.0.0 239.255.0.1 
- it joins multicast port and listens for incoming clients connect at port 40001 (presently hard coded).  

2. Subscribe the tcp_ client with required subscription type: ./tcp_client 127.0.0.1 40001 7
- It has capablity to subscribe combination of 3 messages MarketStatus(1), Quote(2), Trade statistics(4) - combination could be provided by sending 5 which means subscribe to Trade Statistics and Market status

3.Feed the data using: ./mcast_sender 239.255.0.1 1
- it requires a binary file which has relevant messages. The file messages.dat is kept in doc folder. This should be copied in the folder from where we run mcast_sender binary and renamed to messages.dat to be read by mcast_sender. messages.dat.9999 contains 9999 Quote message, 9999 Trade message and 2 Market status message.

LOGS
#############################################################
1. tcp_client1.log(Market Status subscription), tcp_client2.log(Quote subscription), tcp_client4.log(Trade subscription) and tcp_client7.log(All subscriptions) are kept in log folder for reference.
